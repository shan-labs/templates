{{ '*' if cookiecutter.readme_type == 'org' else '#'}} Notice

This file is a WIP! Feel free to make a pull request and a maintainer will reply shortly. The only thing to note is that
all pull requests should be made from a branch and not directly from a fork's master to our master branch (this makes
rebasing for maintainers easier).

Thanks for understanding and contributing!
